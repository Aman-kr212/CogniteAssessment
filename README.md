# Messenger App

This is a basic messenger app built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to select friends, send messages, and view chat history (without persistence).

## Features

- **Friend List**: Select a friend to chat with.
- **Chat Window**: Send and view messages in a chat interface.
- **Message Input**: Expands with new lines as needed, up to 3 lines with a scroll.

## Goals

1. Users can write and send messages in the chat window and see them appear in real-time.
2. Users can select a friend and view the chat history with that specific friend.

## Technologies Used

- **React** and **TypeScript** for building a robust UI.
- **CSS Flexbox** for layout and responsiveness.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aman-kr212/CogniteAssessment.git

   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.


## Notes

- The app is designed to be a simple prototype with a focus on UI functionality.
